All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- a new mutation operator: decompose search which is used for bigger problem instances



## [v1.7.3] - 2021-01-08

### Changed

- update `hre` format support to v2 version
- update dependencies


## [v1.7.2] - 2020-12-05

- apply minor algorithm changes


## [v1.7.1] - 2020-11-29

This release focuses on improving performance and bug fixing.

### Changed

- use `stale` flag internally to avoid route state updates on non-changed routes

### Removed

- remove unstable push tour departure LS method


## [v1.7.0] - 2020-11-23

This release features a new solution space exploration algorithm called ROSOMAXA: Routing Optimizations
with Self Organizing MAps and eXtrAs (pronounced as "rosomaha", from russian "росомаха" - "wolverine").

### Added

- add and use by default rosomaxa algorithm
- add a new LS method to push tour departure in the future
- add a Local Search mutation
- add farthest insertion heuristic

### Changed

- move Local Search out of Ruin Recreate mutation
- `breaking`: use string as unassigned job reason code


## [v1.6.4] - 2020-10-27

### Added

- tour size constraint which limits amount of job activities per tour


## [v1.6.3] - 2020-10-21

### Added

- introduce dispatch feature to support vehicle dispatching functionality (depot replacement)

## Removed

- `breaking`: removed depot feature

## Changed

- `ExchangeIntraRouteRandom` now removes and reinserts with noise a single random job


## [v1.6.2] - 2020-10-18

### Changed

- `breaking`: job skills are now defined by `allOf`, `oneOf` and `noneOf` conditions
- use `hashbrown` library in `pragmatic` crate
- fixed minor bugs

### Removed

- `config` property from `pragmatic` format


## [v1.6.1] - 2020-10-15

### Added

- `breaks` property in `minimize-unassigned` objective
- dependencies audit by `github actions`

### Changed

- break assignment is made less strict by default. User has certain control on its assignment by the objective
- replaced `uniform_real(0., 1.)` usage with `is_hit` method in `Random` trait
- default parameters of local search operators

### Fixed

- minor tech debt


## [v1.6.0] - 2020-10-14

### Added

- cargo features to build `cli` library without certain dependencies
- proper `k-regret` recreate method
- `recreate-with-perturbation` recreate method
- add `local search` operators to ruin recreate mutation:
    - inter route best
    - inter route random
    - intra route random

### Changed

- renamed regret to `skip-best` method

### Fixed

- some issues in init readers


## [v1.5.0] - 2020-09-07

### Added

- accept location indices for routing matrix

### Changed

- do not generate initial solutions when initial solution supplied

### Fixed

- ruin bug with zero-cost jobs
- population size performance issue
- incorrect checker expectations regarding `vehicleId` template


## v1.0.0 - 2020-04-09

- Initial public release


## v0.0.1 - 2019-08-26

- Initial commit
